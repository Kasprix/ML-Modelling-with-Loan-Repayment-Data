## Introduction
This project showcases several techniques and tools used for data analysis and machine learning. The notebook demonstrates how to preprocess data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and apply machine learning models.

## Setup and Installation
To run the notebook, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. Follow the steps below to set up your environment:

### Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/kasprix/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
```

### Create a virtual environment and activate it:
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### Install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```
jupyter notebook
```

Open the `initial_coding.ipynb` notebook in the Jupyter interface.

## Notebook Contents
The notebook is structured as follows:

1. **Data Loading and Preparation**: Importing libraries, loading datasets, and preparing the data for analysis.
2. **Data Exploration**: Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and transforming data.
4. **Visualization**: Creating plots and visualizations to illustrate data insights.
5. **Machine Learning**: Implementing machine learning models to make predictions and evaluate performance.

## Usage
You can run the notebook cell by cell to understand each step of the data processing and analysis workflow. Modify the code as needed to suit your specific use case.
